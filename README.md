关于我：

我叫彭勃，出生于中国。毕业于萨斯喀彻温大学，金融系。在大学的四年里面，我尝试去弄懂什么是金融，当我发现金融不过是一场零和游戏的时候，
我决定离开，转身投向我从小便热爱的领域。

记得是小学二年级，我爸爸带回来一台笔记本电脑，里面装的是windows 95的操作系统。从那时起，我便和电脑结下了不解之缘。很不幸的是，那台笔记本
在我的摧残下，并没有坚持多久。陆陆续续的这十几年，我不得不说我弄坏了好几台电脑，我很感谢我的父母没有制止我对电脑的热情。

我还记得那时候的windows 95是很容易蓝屏的，而且也不懂得如何正确的开关机。长此以往的结果就是，那台笔记本已经不能正常启动了。我从书店
买了一本教人如何重装系统的书，然后照着上面的步骤一步一步的，当我看见屏幕重新出现win 95的logo在飘的时候，有一种说不出来的喜悦。那便是
我第一次接触DOS。

后来，我又报了学校的电脑兴趣班，学会了flash和制作网页。当时还是web 1.0时代，还记得老师教我们用frontpage这个软件来制作简单的静态页面，
那时候觉得真的叼爆了。

而后的十几年，家里的电脑买了坏，坏了自己修，修好又坏，坏了再买，周而复始。在从中我也学会了很多同龄小孩都不知道的知识，比如：CPU, RAM的原理，
二进制，DOS命令，拆风扇，当然还有好多好多的游戏知识。

网络的发达，同时感谢搜索引擎的帮忙，让学习变得如此简单。再后来，因为家里装修，我便尝试学习3dmax和X-ray，然后把渲染的照片交给父母看，虽然
最后家里也没有变成照片上的样子

再后来的后来，
为了制作logo，自学Illustrator。
为了剪辑拍摄好的影片，自学premiere。
为了做一个网站，自学HTML,CSS和javascript，
为了让这个网站有生命，自学php，mysql和python，
为了管理大量数据，自学了Excel VBA，

直到iphone的出现，直到乔布斯给人类带来的美，直到他的突然离去，直到他告诉我们设计的重要性，我意识到我是不是也应该做点什么。

我希望变成人生的建筑师，帮助人们建造自己的人生。这便是我。

My name is Bo Peng, I was born in China. I graduated with a background of finance from the University of Saskatchewan, 
where I spent most of time on trying to figure out how money works. After understanding the conspiracy of finance, 
I decided to not waste my life on a zero-sum game. Therefore, I returned into another area that I have been interested in since I was young.

I still remember that my dad brought a laptop home when I was in the third grade. The laptop was running on a Windows 95 operating
system. I was very curious and enthusiastic about computers since then. Unfortunately, that laptop didn't last very long under my torture. I have to
say that I am always grateful to my parents for not being against my passion about computers even thought I had ruined several machines in following decades.

Knowing little about computers made the laptop show the blue screen of death so frequently that it won't boot up eventually. I bought a book telling people how 
to install the operating system, and I followed the guide step by step hoping that the laptop will reborn somehow by itself. It was an joy that I couldn't tell 
when I saw the Windows' logo fluttering on the monitor. That was the first time I had dug into the DOS system.

Soon afterwards I attended a computer class to learned flash and web page development. It was in the web 1.0 era, and websites were static at that time. Although 
the teacher just taught me how to make an simple web page using a software called FrontPage, I was still fascinated by how computers could understand people's ideas.

After I stepped into the 21st century, it became so much easier to learn something under a rapid development of the internet. Thank Google as well as Baidu for providing 
such amount of valuable resources.

During my high school, I taught myself PhotoShop when my classmates asked me if I could somehow make their selfies look prettier.
During my college, 
    I taught myself Illustrator when my teammates asked me if I could make a team logo for the group.
    I learned 3dMax because my parents would like to know how their home would look like after a renovation.    
    one of my best friend had an idea about doing business online, and he asked me if I could give a hand, so I taught myself HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
    I decided to self-leaned php and python as I need to grab some information from certain websites. I build my own little web crawler at that time.
    
After graduation, I found a job in Shenzhen where is located in southern China. Despite of some common programming and designing tasks, 
I also have to manage hundreds of thousands of lines of data. Therefore, I taught myself the language of Excel which is VBA("Visual Basic for Applications) to 
make my life easier.

The Apple Inc. leading by Steve Jobs taught us the importance of design, and after Steve Jobs passed away, I realized that perhaps I could do something 
to make people's life easier as well

I am devoted to be a "Life Architect", to help people build their own life.

This is about me.
